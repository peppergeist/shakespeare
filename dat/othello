O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on.
    [ Othello, III.iii.195-197 ]

But men are men; the best sometimes forget.
    [ Othello, II.iii.256 ]

...men in rage strike those that wish them best...
    [ Othello, II.iii.258 ]

When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes,
Patience her injury a mock’ry makes.
The robbed that smiles steals something from the
    thief;
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
    [ Othello, I.iii.232-240 ]
%
    Reputation is an idle and
most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost
without deserving. You have lost no reputation at
all, unless you repute yourself such a loser.
    [ Othello, II.iii.287-290 ]
%
    O
God, that men should put an enemy in their
mouths to steal away their brains! That we should
with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause transform
ourselves into beasts!
    [Othello, II.iii.308-312 ]
%
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls.
Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something,
nothing;
’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to
thousands.
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed.
    [ Othello, III.iii.182-190 ]
%
She loved me for the dangers I had passed,
And I loved her that she did pity them.
    [ Othello, I.iii.193-194 ]
%
How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    [ Othello, II.iii.391-392 ]
%
    ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or
thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our
wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles
or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme,
supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it
with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or
manured with industry, why the power and corrigible
authority of this lies in our wills.
    [ Othello, I.iii.361-368 ]

    Men should be what they seem;
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
    [ Othello, III.iii.147-148 ]
%
    O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
But O, what damnèd minutes tells he o’er
Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!
    [ Othello, III.iii.195-200 ]
%
I kissed thee ere I killed thee. No way but this,
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
    [ Othello, V.ii.420-421 ]
%
It is silliness to live, when to live is torment,
and then have we a prescription to die when death is
our physician.
    [ Othello, I.iii.350-352 ]
%
BRABANTIO   Thou art a villain.
IAGO    You are a senator.
    [ Othello, I.i.132-133 ]
%
IAGO    What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
CASSIO  Ay, past all surgery.
IAGO    Marry, God forbid!
CASSIO  Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have
lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
Iago, my reputation!
    [ Othello, II.iii.278-284 ]

    Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown
cats and blind puppies.
    [ Othello, I.iii.378-379 ]

But jealous souls will not be answered so.
They are not ever jealous for the cause,
But jealous for they’re jealous. It is a monster
Begot upon itself, born on itself.
    [ Othello, III.iv.180-183 ]
%
    My noble father,
I do perceive here a divided duty.
To you I am bound for life and education.
My life and education both do learn me
How to respect you. You are the lord of duty.
I am hitherto your daughter. But here’s my
husband.
And so much duty as my mother showed
To you, preferring you before her father,
So much I challenge that I may profess
Due to the Moor my lord.
    [ Othello, I.iii.208-218 ]
%
But words are words. I never yet did hear
That the bruised heart was piercèd through the
    ear.
    [ Othello, I.iii.249-251 ]
%
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
But seeming so for my peculiar end.
For when my outward action doth demonstrate
The native act and figure of my heart
In complement extern, ’tis not long after
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
For daws to peck at. I am not what I am.
    [ Othello, I.i.65-71 ]

IAGO
She that was ever fair and never proud,
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
Never lacked gold and yet went never gay,
Fled from her wish, and yet said “Now I may,”
She that being angered, her revenge being nigh,
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
She that in wisdom never was so frail
To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail,
She that could think and ne’er disclose her mind,
See suitors following and not look behind,
She was a wight, if ever such wight were--
DESDEMONA To do what?
IAGO
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
    [ Othello, II.i.163-175 ]
%
CASSIO  Dost thou hear, mine honest friend?
CLOWN   No, I hear not your honest friend, I hear you.
    [ Othello, III.i.22-23 ]

But I do think it is their husbands’ faults
If wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties,
And pour our treasures into foreign laps;
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,
Or scant our former having in despite.
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them. They see, and
    smell,
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
As husbands have. What is it that they do
When they change us for others? Is it sport?
I think it is. And doth affection breed it?
I think it doth. Is ’t frailty that thus errs?
It is so too. And have not we affections,
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Then let them use us well. Else let them know,
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
    [ Othello, IV.iii.97-115 ]

Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;
But riches fineless is as poor as winter
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
