O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on.
    [ Othello, III.iii.195-197 ]

But men are men; the best sometimes forget.

...men in rage strike those that wish them best...
    [ Othello, II.iii.258 ]

When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes,
Patience her injury a mockâ€™ry makes.
The robbed that smiles steals something from the
    thief;
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
    [ Othello, I.iii.232-240 ]
