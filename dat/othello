O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on.
    [ Othello, III.iii.195-197 ]

But men are men; the best sometimes forget.
    [ Othello, II.iii.256 ]

...men in rage strike those that wish them best...

When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes,
Patience her injury a mock’ry makes.
The robbed that smiles steals something from the
    thief;
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
    [ Othello, I.iii.232-240 ]

    Reputation is an idle and
most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost
without deserving. You have lost no reputation at
all, unless you repute yourself such a loser.

    O
God, that men should put an enemy in their
mouths to steal away their brains! That we should
with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause transform
ourselves into beasts!
    [Othello, II.iii.308-312 ]

Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls.
Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something,
nothing;
’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to
thousands.
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed.
    [ Othello, III.iii.182-190 ]
%
She loved me for the dangers I had passed,
And I loved her that she did pity them.
    [ Othello, I.iii.193-194 ]

How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    [ Othello, II.iii.391-392 ]

    ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or
thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our
wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles
or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme,
supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it
with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or
manured with industry, why the power and corrigible
authority of this lies in our wills.
    [ Othello, I.iii.361-368 ]

    Men should be what they seem;
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
    [ Othello, III.iii.147-148 ]

    O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
But O, what damnèd minutes tells he o’er
Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!
    [ Othello, III.iii.195-200 ]
%
I kissed thee ere I killed thee. No way but this,
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
    [ Othello, V.ii.420-421 ]
%
It is silliness to live, when to live is torment,
and then have we a prescription to die when death is
our physician.
