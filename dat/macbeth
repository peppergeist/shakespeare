# Macbeth

% ACT I, SCENE iv
    Stars, hide your fires;
Let not light see my black and deep desires.
The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

    Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

% ACT I, SCENE vi
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
Which still we thank as love.
    [ Macbeth, I.iv.14-15 ]
%
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time. Bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue. Look like th’ innocent
flower,
But be the serpent under ’t.
    [ Macbeth, I.vi.73-78 ]
% ACT I, SCENE vii
False face must hide what the false heart doth
know.

I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares do more is none.

    [Drink] provokes
the desire, but it takes away the performance.

Who could refrain
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
Courage to make ’s love known?
    [ Macbeth, II.iii.135-137 ]

    Things without all remedy
Should be without regard. What’s done is done.
    [ Macbeth, III.ii.13-14 ]
% ACT IV, SCENE i
Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
    [ Macbeth, IV.i.10-11 ]

By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
Open, locks,
Whoever knocks.
    [ Macbeth, IV.i.44-47 ]
% ACT IV, SCENE iii
Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak
Whispers the o’erfraught heart and bids it break.

Dispute it like a man.

    Unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles. Infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
    [ Macbeth, V.ii.75-77 ]
% ACT V, SCENE v
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time,
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.
    [ Macbeth, V.v.22-31 ]
