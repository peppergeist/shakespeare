A wretched soul bruised with adversity
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry,
But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
As much or more we should ourselves complain.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE We’ll draw cuts for the signior.
Till then, lead thou first.
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Nay, then, thus:
We came into the world like brother and brother,
And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before
  another.

He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.

To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
What, was I married to her in my dream?
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
Until I know this sure uncertainty
I’ll entertain the offered fallacy.

Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.
That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to

Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.

O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
And careful hours with time’s deformèd hand

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE      What is she?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE  A very reverend body, ay, such a
one as a man may not speak of without he say
“sir-reverence.” I have but lean luck in the match,
and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE How dost thou mean a “fat
marriage”?
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE  Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen
wench, and all grease, and I know not what use to
put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from
her by her own light. I warrant her rags and the
tallow in them will burn a Poland winter. If she lives
till doomsday, she’ll burn a week longer than the
whole world.

Sweet mistress—what your name is else I know not,
  Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine—
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
  Than our Earth’s wonder, more than Earth divine.
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak.
  Lay open to my earthy gross conceit,
Smothered in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
  The folded meaning of your words’ deceit.
Against my soul’s pure truth why labor you
  To make it wander in an unknown field?
Are you a god? Would you create me new?
  Transform me, then, and to your power I’ll yield.
But if that I am I, then well I know
  Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe.
  Far more, far more, to you do I decline.
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note
  To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears.
Sing, Siren, for thyself, and I will dote.
  Spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
And as a bed I’ll take them and there lie,
  And in that glorious supposition think
He gains by death that hath such means to die.
  Let love, being light, be drownèd if she sink.

And the great care of goods at random left
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;
From whom my absence was not six months old
Before herself—almost at fainting under
The pleasing punishment that women bear—
Had made provision for her following me
And soon and safe arrivèd where I was.

Returned so soon? Rather approached too late!
The capon burns; the pig falls from the spit;
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
My mistress made it one upon my cheek.
She is so hot because the meat is cold;
The meat is cold because you come not home;
You come not home because you have no stomach;
You have no stomach, having broke your fast.
But we that know what ’tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default today.

I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
DUKE
One of these men is genius to the other.
And so, of these, which is the natural man
And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?

I, sir, am Dromio. Command him away.

I, sir, am Dromio. Pray, let me stay.

Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
Or else what lets it but he would be here?
Sister, you know he promised me a chain.
Would that alone o’ love he would detain,
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed.
I see the jewel best enamelèd
Will lose his beauty. Yet the gold bides still
That others touch, and often touching will
Wear gold; yet no man that hath a name
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
I’ll weep what’s left away, and weeping die.

Neither my husband nor the slave returned
That in such haste I sent to seek his master?
Sure, Luciana, it is two o’clock.
LUCIANA
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner.
Good sister, let us dine, and never fret.
A man is master of his liberty;
Time is their master, and when they see time
They’ll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.

Why should their liberty than ours be more?
