This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.

Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

Doubt thou the stars are fire;
  Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
  But never doubt I love.

Why then, 'tis none to you, for there is
nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it
so.
