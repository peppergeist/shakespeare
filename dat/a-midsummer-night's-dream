Love can transpose to form and dignity.
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.

Lord, what fools these mortals be!

    For aught that I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth.

    And yet, to say the truth, reason
and love keep little company together nowadays.
The more the pity that some honest neighbors will
not make them friends.

Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends.
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet
Are of imagination all compact.
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold:
That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt.
The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth to
    heaven,
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
    [ A Midsummer Night's Dream, V.i.4-18 ]

If we shadows have offended,
Think but this and all is mended:
That you have but slumbered here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend.
If you pardon, we will mend.
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearnèd luck
Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,
We will make amends ere long.
Else the Puck a liar call.
So good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.
    [ A Midsummer Night's Dream, V.i.440-455 ]

I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell
To die upon the hand I love so well.
    [ A Midsummer Night's Dream, II.i.250-251 ]

Things growing are not ripe until their season;
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason.
And touching now the point of human skill,
Reason becomes the marshal to my will
And leads me to your eyes, where I o’erlook
Love’s stories written in love’s richest book.
    [ A Midsummer Night's Dream, II.ii.124-129 ]
%
And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye,
Steal me awhile from mine own company.
    [ A Midsummer Night's Dream, III.ii.464-465 ]
%
Your virtue is my privilege. For that
It is not night when I do see your face,
Therefore I think I am not in the night.
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
For you, in my respect, are all the world.
Then, how can it be said I am alone
When all the world is here to look on me?
    [ A Midsummer Night's Dream, II.i.227-233 ]
%
O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe!
    [ A Midsummer Night's Dream, III.ii.45-46 ]
