Few love to hear the sins they love to act.

For death remembered should be like a mirror
Who tells us life’s but breath, to trust it error.

Opinion’s but a fool that makes us scan
The outward habit by the inward man.

LORD
That’s the least fear, for, by the semblance
Of their white flags displayed, they bring us peace
And come to us as favorers, not as foes.
CLEON
Thou speak’st like him’s untutored to repeat
“Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.”

THIRD FISHERMAN
Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.
FIRST FISHERMAN Why, as men do a-land: the great
ones eat up the little ones. I can compare our rich
misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale: he plays
and tumbles, driving the poor fry before him and
at last devours them all at a mouthful. Such
whales have I heard on a’ the land, who never leave
gaping till they swallowed the whole parish—
church, steeple, bells and all.
    [ Pericles, Prince of Tyre, II.i.28-36 ]

    Sit down. Thou art no flatterer.
I thank thee for ’t; and heaven forbid
That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid.

’Tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss...

Those palates who not yet two savors younger
Must have inventions to delight the taste,
Would now be glad of bread and beg for it.
    [ Pericles, Prince of Tyre, I.iv.40-42 ]

Which welcome we’ll accept, feast here awhile,
Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.

    O you gods!
Why do you make us love your goodly gifts
And snatch them straight away? We here below
Recall not what we give, and therein may
Use honor with you.
    [ Pericles, Prince of Tyre, III.i.24-28 ]

My recompense is thanks, that’s all;
Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.
