# As You Like It

% ACT I, SCENE iii
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.

    Were it not better,
Because that I am more than common tall,
That I did suit me all points like a man?
A gallant curtal-ax upon my thigh,
A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart
Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will,
We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside—
As many other mannish cowards have
That do outface it with their semblances.
    [ As You Like It, I.iii.121-129 ]
% ACT II, SCENE i
Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.
And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
    [ As You Like It, II.i.12-17 ]
% ACT II, SCENE iii
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty,
For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
The means of weakness and debility.
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
Frosty but kindly.
    [ As You Like It, II.iii.48-54 ]
% ACT II, SCENE v
  Under the greenwood tree
  Who loves to lie with me
  And turn his merry note
  Unto the sweet bird’s throat,
Come hither, come hither, come hither.
    Here shall he see
    No enemy
But winter and rough weather.
    [ As You Like It, II.v.1-8 ]
% ACT II, SCENE iv
    We that are true lovers run into strange
capers. But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature
in love mortal in folly.

% ACT II, SCENE vii
    All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players.
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

Do you not know I am a woman? When I

JAQUES
Rosalind is your love's name?
ORLANDO
    Yes, just.
JAQUES
I do not not like her name.
ORLANDO
    There was no thought of pleasing you when
she was christened.

    Time
travels in divers paces with divers persons. I’ll tell
you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal,
who time gallops withal, and who he stands still
withal.

    Love is merely a madness,
and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a
whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are
not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so
ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I
profess curing it by counsel.

I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
For I am falser than vows made in wine.
    [ As You Like It, III.v.77-78 ]
% ACT IV, SCENE i
I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which
is emulation; nor the musician’s, which is fantastical;
nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the
soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s,
which is politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor
the lover’s, which is all these; but it is a melancholy
of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted
from many objects, and indeed the sundry
contemplation of my travels, in which my often
rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.

Men have died from time to time and worms have

    Men are April when they
woo, December when they wed. Maids are May
when they are maids, but the sky changes when
they are wives.

    The fool doth think he is wise, but the
wise man knows himself to be a fool.

    The heathen
philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
would open his lips when he put it into his mouth,
meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
lips to open.
