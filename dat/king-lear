When we are born, we cry that we are come
To this great stage of fools.

LEAR    Speak.
CORDELIA    Nothing, my lord.
LEAR            Nothing?
CORDELIA            Nothing.
LEAR
Nothing will come of nothing. Speak again.
    [ King Lear, I.i.95-99 ]

As flies to wanton boys are we to th’ gods;
They kill us for their sport.

    The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman.

LEAR
Does any here know me? This is not Lear.
Does Lear walk thus, speak thus? Where are his
eyes?
Either his notion weakens, his discernings
Are lethargied—Ha! Waking? ’Tis not so.
Who is it that can tell me who I am?
    [ King Lear, I.iv.231-236 ]
%
The weight of this sad time we must obey,
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
The oldest hath borne most; we that are young
Shall never see so much nor live so long.
    [ King Lear, V.iii.392-395 ]

This is the excellent foppery of the world, that
when we are sick in fortune (often the surfeits of
our own behavior) we make guilty of our disasters
the sun, the moon, and stars, as if we were villains
on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves,
thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance;
drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced
obedience of planetary influence; and all that we
are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable
evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
disposition on the charge of a star!
    [ King Lear, I.ii.125-135 ]
%
FOOL If thou wert my Fool, nuncle, I’d have thee
beaten for being old before thy time.
LEAR How’s that?
FOOL Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
been wise.
    [ King Lear, I.v.41-44 ]
%
And worse I may be yet. The worst is not
So long as we can say “This is the worst.”
    [ King Lear, IV.i.30-31 ]
%
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,
Turn all her mother’s pains and benefits
To laughter and contempt, that she may feel
How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is
To have a thankless child.
    [ King Lear, I.iv.298-303 ]
%
No, no, no, no. Come, let’s away to prison.
We two alone will sing like birds i’ th’ cage.
When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel down
And ask of thee forgiveness. So we’ll live,
And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
Talk of court news, and we’ll talk with them too—
Who loses and who wins; who’s in, who’s out—
And take upon ’s the mystery of things,
As if we were God’s spies. And we’ll wear out,
In a walled prison, packs and sects of great ones
That ebb and flow by th’ moon.
    [ King Lear, V.iii.9-20 ]
%
    I am a man
More sinned against than sinning.
    [ King Lear, III.ii.62-63 ]

This cold night will turn us all to fools and
madmen.

GLOUCESTER O, let me kiss that hand!
LEAR Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.

Blow winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow!
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
Till you have drenched our steeples, text from the First Quarto not found in the Foliodrownedtext from the First Quarto not found in the Folio the
  cocks.
You sulph’rous and thought-executing fires,
Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
Singe my white head. And thou, all-shaking
  thunder,
Strike flat the thick rotundity o’ th’ world.
Crack nature’s molds, all germens spill at once
That makes ingrateful man.

OSWALD Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
KENT Fellow, I know thee.
OSWALD What dost thou know me for?
KENT A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a
base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound,
filthy worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered,
action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, superserviceable,
finical rogue; one-trunk-inheriting
slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good
service, and art nothing but the composition of a
knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir
of a mongrel bitch; one whom I will beat into
clamorous whining if thou deny’st the least syllable
of thy addition.

    Men must endure
Their going hence even as their coming hither.
Ripeness is all. Come on.

    Love’s not love
When it is mingled with regards that stands
Aloof from th’ entire point.
    [ King Lear, I.i.275-277 ]
%
When we our betters see bearing our woes,
We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
Who alone suffers suffers most i’ th’ mind,
Leaving free things and happy shows behind.
But then the mind much sufferance doth o’erskip
When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship.
    [ King Lear, III.vii.111-116 ]
%
    When the
  mind’s free,
The body’s delicate. This tempest in my mind
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats there.
    [ King Lear, III.iv.13-17 ]
%
The art of our necessities is strange
And can make vile things precious.
    [ King Lear, III.ii.76-77 ]
%
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face.
    [ King Lear, IV.ii.39-40 ]

He’s mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a
horse’s health, a boy’s love, or a whore’s oath.

’Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind.

Through tattered clothes small vices do appear.
Robes and furred gowns hide all. Plate sin with
  gold,
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks.
Arm it in rags, a pygmy’s straw does pierce it.

Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich being poor;
Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised,
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon,
Be it lawful I take up what’s cast away.
Gods, gods! ’Tis strange that from their cold’st
  neglect
My love should kindle to enflamed respect.—
Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my
  chance,
Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.
Not all the dukes of wat’rish Burgundy
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.—
Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.
Thou losest here a better where to find.
