SALISBURY
Then let’s make haste away and look unto the main.
WARWICK
Unto the main? O father, Maine is lost!
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win
And would have kept so long as breath did last!
Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,
Which I will win from France or else be slain.

My lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,
Is this the fashions in the court of England?
Is this the government of Britain’s isle
And this the royalty of Albion’s king?
What, shall King Henry be a pupil still
Under the surly Gloucester’s governance?
Am I a queen in title and in style,
And must be made a subject to a duke?

QUEEN MARGARET  (Queen Margaret drops her fan)
                (to Duchess)
Give me my fan. What, minion, can
you not?        (she gives the Duchess a box on the ear)
I cry you mercy, madam. Was it you?
DUCHESS
Was ’t I? Yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman.
Could I come near your beauty with my nails,
I’d set my ten commandments in your face.

How irksome is this music to my heart!
When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?

Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,
And in his simple show he harbors treason.
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.

The Commons, like an angry hive of bees
That want their leader, scatter up and down
And care not who they sting in his revenge.

For where thou art, there is the world itself,
With every several pleasure in the world;
And where thou art not, desolation.
I can no more. Live thou to joy thy life;
Myself no joy in naught but that thou liv’st.

O, that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder
Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!
Small things make base men proud. This villain
  here,
Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more
Than Bargulus, the strong Illyrian pirate.
Drones suck not eagles’ blood, but rob beehives.
It is impossible that I should die
By such a lowly vassal as thyself.
Thy words move rage and not remorse in me.

[My] imperial tongue is stern and rough,
Used to command, untaught to plead for favor.
Far be it we should honor such as these
With humble suit. No, rather let my head
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
Save to the God of heaven and to my king;
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
Than stand uncovered to the vulgar groom.
True nobility is exempt from fear.—
More can I bear than you dare execute.

        Is not this a lamentable
thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should
be made parchment? That parchment, being scribbled
o’er, should undo a man? Some say the bee
stings, but I say, ’tis the beeswax; for I did but seal
once to a thing, and I was never mine own man
since.

SMITH The clerk of Chartham. He can write and read

CADE O, monstrous!

CADE Here’s a villain!
